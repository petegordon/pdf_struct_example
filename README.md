# pdf_struct_example

build the devcontainer in vscode (you can use the vscode devcontainer extension with docker container)

run the initialize.sh to install pyenv and set environment path

run the commands in py_install to install python 3.8.5 and the pdf_struct module

run python test_struct.py and you'll see error with the model being loaded by pickle
